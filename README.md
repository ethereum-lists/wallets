The idea to create this repo came after [WalletUncon](https://walletuncon.org).
We need a way to discover/compare wallets - like protolambda mentioned in a reply to his rant about wallets - ["Who is building the L2Beat of web3 wallets?"](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1728829926697288020). 
This repository is intended to be the data-basis for this and an attempt to decouple data from usage.
